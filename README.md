# HPSTR Theme for Octopress
This is a port of the [HPSTR Theme][HPSTR] by [mmistakes][mmistakes] for Octopress. The theme was initially built for Jekyll and Less; this theme is written entirely in Sass and makes use of the Octopress 2.0 blogging framework.

## Preview
To see a live preview of the theme, check out mmistakes's [live Jekyll version][jekyll-preview]. You can also feel free to check out [blog.jez.io][blog] which currently uses the HPSTR theme for Octopress (you can also check out the source of this repo to get a feel for getting the theme to work with an Octopress installation.)

## Installation
### Walkthrough
> #### Hey you with the trigger happy command line
> Before you run the following commands, if you already have an Octopress theme installed, you may want to move your `source/` and `sass/` folders to `source.bak/` and `sass.bak/`, respectively. During the Octopress installation process, any residual files from old themes that are not overwritten can pollute your source directory and cause confusing build errors. To avoid this, simply back up these files and restore those specific files which are specific to your blog (i.e., special pages you may have introduced and all of your `_posts/` directory, among other files).

Installing themes in Octopress 2.0 is done using the `.themes` directory of your project.
```bash
$ cd your-octopress-blog
$ git submodule add https://github.com/jez/hpstr-theme.git .themes/hpstr
$ rake install['hpstr']
$ rake generate
```
> ### Note
> If the `rake` commands don't work, you may have to try `bundle exec rake`, depending on how you have ruby installed on your system.

### Setting up your `_config.yml`, `config.rb`, and Gemfile
This theme requires a lot of changes to your `_config.yml`, which are all documented [here](Properties.md). Make sure you check it out and add the new required fields.

For the stylesheets to be loaded properly, you need to configure Compass to generate your static file assets into the `source/` folder. This can be done in `config.rb`. By prefixing all the output paths (`css_dir` in particular) with '`source/`', Compass will know that it should actually place the generated files inside of folders within the `source/` directory. To give an example, my config.rb contains the lines:

```ruby
css_dir = "source/stylesheets"
sass_dir = "sass"
```

This tells Compass to look in the folder `sass/` for scss files, and to place them inside `source/stylesheets/` when the css files are compiled. Once inside the `source/stylesheets` directory, running `rake generate` will take care of moving them into `public/`.

Octopress unfortunately ships with an out-of-date version of Compass. This theme uses features of Compass that are not available in the version it ships with, namely the file "compass/css3/animation". To fix this, edit the line in your `Gemfile` that begins with

```ruby
  ...
  gem "compass", ~> ...
  ...
```

to one of the following (depending on whether you want cutting edge updates or a more restricted update schedule, respectively).

```ruby
  ...
  gem "compass"
  ...

# OR

  ...
  gem "compass", "~> 1.0.1"
  ...
```

If you don't get this, you will get an error like

```
error sass/screen.scss (Line 15: File to import not found or unreadable: compass/css3/animation.)
```

Once you do this, re-run `bundle update` to get the updated version of Compass.

## Features

### MathJax

To enable [MathJax][mathjax] on a post or page, include `mathjax: true` in the
front matter for a page. You can see the default MathJax configurations in
[mathjax.html](source/_includes/mathjax.html).

## What Next
There are a lot of cool things you can do after installing HPSTR for Octopress.

#### Get blogging!
After installing this theme, especially on a fresh Octopress blog, you should be able to start blogging right away. If you can't, let me know in an issue. I'd love to see if I can help you troubleshoot or to fix bugs in my handiwork.

#### Read the docs!
You can read about the Sass documents [here](sass/README.md), and about the various properties that are used throughout the configuration files and front matter [here](Properties.md). I __really__ care about well documented code, so if there's something you think could be explaned better or you need help navigating something, _please_ submit an issue or send me a message [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Z1MM32M4N).

#### Submit Pull Requests!
I didn't port every feature to Octopress. Instead, I focused mostly on just those which I thought I would personally use. If you like this theme but I left out your favorite feature, be sure to fork this repo, add in your feature _in a separate feature branch_, and submit a pull request.

#### Use SSL!

If you're hosting on GitHub Pages, you're in luck! [GitHub Pages now supports
SSL][gh-pages-ssl]. This works even if you're on a custom domain if you sign up
for the CloudFlare free tier.

## Octopress 3.0
Octopress 3.0 is [in the works][v3]! This release, however, is [going to be vastly different][migration] from Octopress 2.0. In Octopress 3.0, [Octopress Ink][ink] will become the method through which themes are created, distributed, and updated, leaving the old method of creating themes used by version 2.0 behind.

Until version 3.0 becomes generally available, you've got a couple of options. The first is obviously to download Octopress 2.0, install HPSTR, and start blogging. This is certainly a viable option, and I'm more than willing to help you if you run into glitches.

The second is to start a Jekyll blog, perhaps by forking mmistakes's HPSTR Theme, and start using the Octopress 3.0 release candidates to manage your blog. As [imathis][imathis] has admitted, as of the time of this writing these release candidates are [not a finished product][migration], which may leave users feeling unsatisfied.

The third option is to wait it out. This certainly doesn't solve the immediate problem of wanting to get a blog up and running, but it has some unique advantages. For one, you don't have to dabble with a buggy and bloated 2.0 codebase. Additionally, by waiting for Octopress Ink to come out and waiting for HPSTR to be ported to it, installing new themes and updating them at any time will likely be a cinch.

I'm sure that there are many more options, not the least of which is to go build your own blogging platform, but these three are pretty good all things considered. Pick whichever you feel best meets your wants and needs.
